## Context

* Introduction of **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)** in manufacturing production process <span class="fa fa-arrow-right"> </span> **Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs)**
* Additional challenges in software systems:
  * Increased software complexity 
  * Increasing heterogeneity of devices 
  * Data distribution in the **Edge-Cloud Continuum**
  * Robustness to faults (**Self-Healing-Fault-Tolerant** techniques)
  * Predictive maintenance 
  * Role of AI and ML in optimizing manufacturing processes

## Industrial case study

* Active collaboration with **SCM Group**, a world leader in producing large woodworking machines.

* Managing hybrid `Linux` and `Windows` computing environments
* Software maintenance is a challenge due to manual configurations and third-party dependencies
* They need their software system capable to:
  * autonomously update their software systems when newer updates are released
  * finely control the operating system version
  * automatic porting of configuration files between OS/software versions  
  * autonomously act in case of failures during this procedure
  * avoid manual intervention for this process
  * allow software to run on outdated hardware (manufacturing machines have longer lifecycle than software)

# Challenges in this case study

* **Deployment**: Managing long-lived industrial hardware while keeping software updated.
Development process is supported by modern techniques (DevOps), but no general tool for deployment.
The deployment process may fails, thus a *rollback* procedure that bring the machine back to the latest working version is required.

* **Heterogeneity**: Handling diverse hardware and software environments across different factories.
Manufacturing software systems must run for a long time, increasing risk that deployment may fail.

* **Dependencies**: Ensuring compatibility between 
  * software versions
  * software and operating system
  * software and dependencies (can be *ranges* of compatibilities) 

* **Critical Environment**: Minimizing downtime and maximize reliability in production environments
  * *dependability* concerns (availability, reliability, maintainability, safety)
  * *security*

### Goal

*Developing autonomous, self-updating,*
*and fault-tolerant manufacturing software systems*

<br />

### Approach

We approach the problem from two complementary directions:

1. *Top-down*: Enhancing state-of-the-art Self-Adaptive Self-Organizing (SASO) systems for adoption in industrial software

2. *Bottom-up*: Developing SASO systems to face practical problem in manufacturing

## Results: TOP-DOWN

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col class="mx-5" %}}

1. We compared SASO systems architectures, and we acknowledged that other research field approaches were not really disconnected from the SASO vision.
We identified that **BDI (Beliefs-Desires-Intentions) Multi-Agent Systems (MASs)**, which literature never considered for SASO systems, were basically proposing the same model description with different aims.
For this reason, we decided to investigate the feasibility of using BDI as a programming framework for SASO systems. 

2. Towards this end, we acknowledged that current BDI frameworks were not suitable for industrial adoption, because of their steep learning curve and lack of ergonomics.
Therefore, we developed **JaKtA**, a BDI framework in Kotlin, which proposes a more ergonomic and developer-friendly approach for BDI programming.

3. During the literature review of existing BDI frameworks, we identified that **concurrency management** was not treated with the required attention, and often hidden under the implementation of the frameworks.
Concurrency is a crucial aspect when dealing with heterogeneous manufacturing systems particularly for the reliability requirement, therefore we classified **concurrency models** in BDI frameworks and highlighted the importance of controlling it.

4. We identified that **testing and validation** of BDI systems before deployment was not sufficiently investigated in the literature.
We proposed **simulation-based validation** for BDI MASs, enabling early detection of deployment issues.
